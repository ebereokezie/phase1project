# JavaScript Project 1 "I Love Hip Hop"

## Description

Javascript project "I Love Hip Hop" is a Single Page Application (SPA) that will allow the user to search for a certain artist, learn select information about the artist, and add the artist to their "favorite" list, if desired.


## Usage

The "I Love Hip Hop" SPA is a simple, yet fun application to use to learn more about individual artists and bands. Simply input the desired artist/band in the search bar and click submit. An "artist card" will populate, showing the name of the artist, artist genre, and country of origin. If the user likes this artist, they can click the favorite button, which will add the artist name to a list of favorites on the side. If the user would like to search for another artist, they may delete the current card, and restart the process.
